Vera C. Rubin Observatory Data Management (DM) subsystem is one of four construction subsystems.
In operations we retain the notion of four departments of which one is DM.
In this paper we describe DM as built as well as the fabric around DM which enabled its success.
The goal of DM in construction was to "Stand up operable, maintainable, quality services to deliver high-quality LSST data products for science and education, all on time and within reasonable cost."
That said we do outline the data products which will be produced by DM software as a part of the overall Rubin effort.
We refer to detail oriented papers in many areas for the interested reader.
