\section{Introduction}

 See also The Ruben Observatory  Data Management System: \cite{2015arXiv151207914J}




\section{Organisation of Data Management} \label{sec:org}
Org chart meetings etc. from \cite{LDM-294}.

\subsection{Relationship to other subsystems}
   We take images from the  LSST camera: \cite{2010SPIE.7735E..0JK}

   We are commanded and listen to the  Telescope  and site software  \cite{2014SPIE.9145E..1AG}


   DM will be verified and validated as part of System verification and validation: \cite{2014SPIE.9150E..0NS}
\section {Architecture, Data Transmission and  Access } \label{sec:dataacess}
System vision diagram
Show network diagram and architecture diagrams for alerts/DRP. Mention Data Access doc  \cite{LDO-013} and
setting up of DACs in Chile and USA.

\section {Software Products} \label{sec:softproduts}
The detailed software approach is covered in \cite{PSTN-019}. Here we go over the main software products.


\section{Data Products} \label{sec:dataproducts}
In operations Data Production will use the the software outlined in \secref{sec:softproducts} to produce the various data products.

 The detailed  Data Products Definition may be found in  \cite{LSE-163}.
Validation of the products is covered in \cite{PSTN-024}.
