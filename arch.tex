\subsection{Data Access} \label{sec:dataaccess}

As shown in \figref{fig:vision} there are several kinds of Rubin data - mostly they are accessed via
the science platform or a community broker.
In addition some products may be accessed via and independent data access center. We will provide a few more details in this section.

\subsubsection{Data Access Centers}

\subsubsection{Alerts and Brokers}
Mention community alert brokers.
