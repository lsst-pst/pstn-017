\subsection{ Data Management transition to operations} \label{sec:transition}

DM aimed for a smooth transition to operations maintaining many of the team members though some DM team members move to System Performance.
The organisation structure was rationalized to match the cyber infrastructure layout in operations and is depicted in \autoref{fig:opsorg}.
The logical make up of this following out data taking to data serving approach is depicted in \autoref{fig:DataMakingServing}.
Leadership remains very similar assisting the transition.

\caption{ The operations organisation follows the cyber infrastructure layout of DM more than the WBS structure of construction (from \cite{RTN-046}).
 It is somewhat simpler than \autoref{fig:dmorg}.  \label{fig:opsorg}}

DM transitioned parts of the system over many years, this was a reality  but partly it was in response to the availability of operational funding requiring us to be more clear about this.
For example once the Science Platform on the summit became a daily requirement it was considered operational and changes were rigorously controlled
this was delivered in 2021 \citep{RTN-019}.
The EFD was officially delivered in 2023 though it has actually been in operations supporting summit activities  since at least 2019.
The change from NCSA to a DOE Data facility in 2020 lead to the creation of the the Interim Data Facility  and the deployment of user facing operational services on Google\citep{2021arXiv211115030O}.
This allowed DM to demonstrate the ability to operate all  of data production and  data serving  which exercised data abstraction and infrastructure through three data previews with simulated data.
This was not all of DM operations but a significant fraction the other main part, data acquisition, was being exercised since 2019 with regular Auxiliary Telescope runs.

Hence over five year DM gradually transitioned to operations while maintaining our ability to develop and improve our systems as we intend to do throughout operations.
