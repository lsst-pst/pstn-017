\section {DM Software Systems} \label{sec:softproducts}
The DM products are not data as many may think, rather the products are software and services to produce those
products.
In operations DM will not exist though an analogous organization called Data Production will spring into existence under similar leadership.

The high level list of DM products is given in \figref{fig:pt}, as may be seen in the  figure we consider software, services and infrastructure as our categories of products.

It must be remarked that these products grew organically to some extent in a less than satisfactory manner.
As mentioned earlier some teams worked within their WBS area and produced planning and products without necessarily paying a lot of attention to other WBS elements. Hence we have some services which are really deployments of software produced by another team e.g Prompt Services and Prompt Software. But we do not always have a service for a piece of software though it may be web accessible and look like a service e.g. QC Products.
Some products are discussed in more below.
