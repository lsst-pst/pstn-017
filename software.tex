\section {DM Software Systems} \label{sec:softproducts}
The DM products are not data as many may think, rather the products are software and services to produce those
products.
The management and organisation of DM change slightly for operations (see \autoref{sec:transition}) but many of the same people have similar operations roles
giving a good continuity.
Going into operations we assessed the way DM works and reconceptualized the organisation around the data flow and cyber infrastructure.

The high level list of DM products is given in \figref{fig:pt}, as may be seen in the  figure we consider software, services and infrastructure as our categories of products.

It must be remarked that these products grew organically to some extent in a less than satisfactory manner.
As mentioned earlier some teams worked within their WBS area and produced planning and products without necessarily paying a lot of attention to other WBS elements. Hence we have some services which are really deployments of software produced by another team e.g Prompt Services and Prompt Software. But we do not always have a service for a piece of software though it may be web accessible and look like a service e.g. QC Products.
Some products are discussed in more below.
