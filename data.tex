\section{Data Products} \label{sec:dataproducts}

The LSST data collected by Rubin Observatory is automatically processed by the LSST science pipelines, as described in (\S~\ref{sec:softproduts})  to produce the LSST data products. The  reduced images, catalogs and alerts. 

\subsection{Data Product  Variety} 
The type/variety of data products include. Describe the science that they will enable 
\begin{itemize}
\item images:  raw single visit images, calibrated processed visit images (PVI), coadd images, cutouts (postage stamps) 
\item catalogs: DR includes Object, Source, DIASource, DIAObject, 
\item alerts: Alerts to objects that have changed in brightness or position on the sky. 
\end{itemize}



Generation of intermediate data products, in particular to generate intermediate flavours of coadds. 

{\tt Object} catalog photo-$z$ data products.


 The detailed  Data Products Definition may be found in  \cite{LSE-163}.
Validation of the products is covered in \cite{PSTN-024}.

\subsection{Data Product Categories} 
LSST defines three categories of data products. 

LSST defines three data product categories,
\begin{itemize}
\item Prompt: 
\item Data Release: 
\item User Generated: 
\end{itemize}
The first two, {\tt Prompt} and {\tt Data Release} data products are produced and delivered by the DM system described in this paper. 
The third, {\tt User Generated} data products are produced by the Rubin Science Community using the {\tt Prompt} and {\tt Data Release} together possibly with data from other surveys. 


The data product categories are outlined in \cite{lse-319}

In operations Data Production will use the the software outlined in \secref{sec:softproducts} to produce the various data products.

\subsection{Data Product Verification}
The quality of all Level 1 and Level 2 data products will be extensively assessed, both automatically as well as manually. 
Described in detail in \cite{pstn-024}
Not sure this section is needed. 


\subsection{Commissioning Data Products}  \label{sec:dp-commissioning}
Describe here (possibly in a table) the exact data products delivered in commissioning and the science that they enable. 
This will be a high level description and can refer to the DP2 DPDD for exact details. 

\subsection{Anticipated Data Release 1 Data Products} \label{sec:dp-dr1}

%\item proper motions for Gaia stars 
\begin{itemize}
\item photometric redshifts
\end{itemize}


The data products delivered during commissioning represent only an initial set of data products. 
The commissioning data set does not enable the production of .... (galaxy shape measurements ... )
In addition to the commissioning data products described in \S~\ref{sec:dp-commissioning}, we anticipate providing: 

This list is neither definitive nor exhaustive; the exact list of data products to be provided as part of future LSST Data Releases will be determined closer to the time of release.
